# PyBear_Analysis

## Project Overview
The CEO of PyBer would like an analysis done of their ride-share data from January to April of 2019 by city type. They would like to see the following:
- A Summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type
- A multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type

## Resources
- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv
- Software: Jupyter Notebook 6.4.5

## Results
### Summary DataFrame

- Rural and Suburban areas have significantly less total rides than Urban areas
- Rural and Suburban areas have significantly less total drivers than Urban areas
- Urban areas combined have the most total fares with approximately $40,000
- Rural areas have a higher average fare per rides compared to Urban and Suburban areas
- Rural areas have a higher average fare per drivers compared to Urban and Suburban areas

### Total Fare by City Type

- From January to April, Urban areas have the highest fares per week while Rural areas have the lowest
- The last week of Feburary appears to be the most profitable week for each city type

## Summary
Based on these results, I would recommend that they find more drivers for rural areas due to the total amount of rides surpassing the total amount of drivers. I would also recommend increasing the amount of drivers for Suburban areas for similar reasons. Lastly, I would recommend a small decrease in rural fares. The high price could be deterring potential customers from seeking rides.
